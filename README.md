# EmployeeManagement
This project is to perform CURD operation using .net 6 version and Entity Framework In Memory Database approach

●	Developed REST endpoints to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) employees using .NET Core WebAPI
●	An employee have some of these properties - firstname, lastname, email address, age etc.
●	The combination of first name, last name and email address should be unique. 
●	The application should start with some employees added.
●	Provide API documentation (like Swagger) to interact with the REST endpoints.

●	Used Entity Framework Core to interact with in-memory database
●	Use Dependency Injection
●	Added unit tests 
●	Added a REST endpoint that takes a search input and then returns a list of employees whose first or last name matches
●	Simulated latency in the API call
